# Homunculus Arena Configuration
# Configuration for multi-agent game environment

# Game orchestration settings
orchestration:
  # LangGraph execution settings

  checkpoint_frequency: 5     # Create checkpoint every N turns
  enable_recovery: true       # Enable game state recovery from checkpoints
  parallel_execution: true   # Enable parallel agent processing
  timeout_seconds: 300       # Game timeout in seconds
  retry_attempts: 3          # Maximum retry attempts on failure

# Game termination settings
termination:
  safety_turn_limit: 50      # Hard safety limit to prevent infinite games
  phase_transition_limits:
    early: 20                # Turns before transitioning to mid phase
    mid: 50                  # Turns before transitioning to late phase

# Elimination mechanics
elimination:
  enabled: true               # Enable agent elimination

  frequency: 10               # Check elimination every N turns
  rate: 0.2                   # Elimination rate (20% chance per check)

# Scoring system
scoring:
  weights:
