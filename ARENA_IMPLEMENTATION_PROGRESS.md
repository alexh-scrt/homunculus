# Arena Implementation Progress Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Arena subproject for Homunculus.
Each phase is completed and tested before moving to the next.

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed on 2025-01-28
**Duration**: Day 1

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Create Arena directory structure
  - Created all source directories under `src/arena/`
  - Created test directories under `tests/arena/`
  - Created config and script directories
  - Added comprehensive docstrings to all `__init__.py` files

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Update dependencies  
  - Added `kafka-python ^2.0.2` for message bus
  - Added `langgraph ^0.2.0` for orchestration
  - Added `psycopg2-binary ^2.9.9` for PostgreSQL
  - Added `pytest-mock ^3.12.0` for testing

- [x] **Task 1.3**: Configure Docker infrastructure
  - Created `docker-compose.arena.yml` with:
    - Kafka and Zookeeper for message bus
    - PostgreSQL for game history
    - Kafka UI for development monitoring
  - Created `scripts/arena/init_db.sql` with complete database schema
  - Configured health checks for all services

- [x] **Task 1.4**: Setup environment configuration
  - Created `.env.arena.example` with all required variables
  - Created `src/arena/config/arena_settings.py` with:
    - Type-safe Pydantic settings
    - Comprehensive validation
    - Property methods for URLs
    - LLM configuration management
    - Scoring weight validation

- [x] **Task 1.5**: Create initial module files
  - All modules have proper docstrings
  - Clear documentation of purpose and structure

- [x] **Task 1.6**: Write Phase 1 validation tests
  - Created `tests/arena/test_phase1_infrastructure.py`
  - Tests for directory structure
  - Tests for dependencies
  - Tests for Docker configuration
  - Tests for environment settings
  - Tests for module imports

### Key Files Created:
```
src/arena/
├── __init__.py (main module)
├── config/arena_settings.py (settings management)
├── */init__.py (all submodules)

tests/arena/
├── __init__.py
├── test_phase1_infrastructure.py

docker-compose.arena.yml
scripts/arena/init_db.sql
.env.arena.example
```

### Validation Results:
- ✅ All directories created successfully
- ✅ Dependencies specified in pyproject.toml
- ✅ Docker configuration valid
- ✅ Environment settings load correctly
- ✅ All modules importable
- ✅ Settings validation working

### Notes & Decisions:
1. **Message Bus**: Chose Kafka over RabbitMQ for better scalability and replay capabilities
2. **Database**: Separate PostgreSQL instance for Arena to avoid conflicts with main Homunculus
3. **Redis**: Using database 1 for Arena (main Homunculus uses database 0)
4. **Settings**: Using Pydantic for type safety and validation
5. **Docker**: Modular approach with separate compose file that can be combined with main

### Assumptions Made:
- LLM API keys will be provided via environment variables
- Docker services will be run locally for development
- PostgreSQL schema uses UUID for game IDs for better distribution
