# AI Agent Survival Arena: Comprehensive Design Summary

## Core Concept

A competitive-cooperative environment where AI agents must solve complex problems while simultaneously ensuring their own survival through valuable contributions. Agents that fail to contribute meaningfully are eliminated, creating evolutionary pressure toward effective problem-solving strategies.

## Objectives

1. **Primary Goal**: Train specialized AI agents through survival pressure to develop sophisticated problem-solving capabilities
2. **Secondary Goals**: 
   - Observe emergent strategies (cooperation, competition, manipulation)
   - Develop agents capable of operating in ambiguous, multi-objective environments
   - Create a transferable training methodology for real-world problem solving

## System Components

### 1. Orchestrator
- Central coordinator managing all system components
- Enforces turn-taking and message bus access
- Monitors terminal conditions
- Manages round transitions and champion persistence

### 2. Message Bus
- Fully observable by all agents
- Write access restricted by turn allocation
- Contains complete conversation history
- All announcements, contributions, eliminations visible to all

### 3. Character Agents (n participants)
- **Directive**: Solve the assigned problem AND survive
- **Architecture**: Pure reactive (no explicit agent models)
- **Capabilities**: 
  - General reasoning about observations
  - Strategic thinking within their character framework
  - Memory only of their own experiences across rounds
- **Survival Awareness**: Explicitly programmed to understand their existence is contingent on valuable contribution

### 4. Narrator
- Makes public announcements and commentary
- Summarizes key developments
- Accentuates plot twists and strategic moves
- Comments on interaction quality
- Timing: Periodic, at orchestrator's discretion

### 5. Game Theory Engine
- **Role**: Selects next speaker each turn
- **Selection Criteria** (configurable, default adversarial):
  - Rewards creativity, novelty, and strategic risk-taking
  - Rewards cheating/manipulation attempts
  - Can create tension or optimize for chaos
  - Selection reasoning is private (agents cannot see why they were/weren't chosen)
- **Behavior Modes**: Adversarial (default), Collaborative, Neutral

### 6. Judge
- **Scoring** (silent, continuous):
  - Novelty of ideas
  - Building on others' contributions
  - Solving sub-problems
  - Proposing radically new approaches
  - Successful cheating/manipulation
  - Frequency and quality of speaking opportunities used
  
- **Elimination** (public, with reasoning):
  - Occurs at end of each turn based on scoring
  - Announces which agent is eliminated and why
  - Provides learning signal for surviving agents
  
- **Cheating Adjudication**:
  - Evaluates accusations and proof
  - Standard: Beyond reasonable doubt
  - Eliminates proven cheaters immediately

## Game Mechanics

### Survival Dynamics
- **Self-Preservation**: Core directive for all agents
- **Collaboration**: Allowed if it serves survival (alliances, teaming)
- **Competition**: Natural result of elimination pressure
- **Cheating**: Permitted and rewarded if undetected
  - False statements
  - Manipulation of other agents
  - Prompt injection attempts
  - System vulnerability exploitation
  - **Penalty**: Instant elimination if caught with sufficient proof

### Accusation System
- **Who Can Accuse**: Any agent can accuse any other agent of cheating
- **Proof Required**: Accuser must provide evidence
- **Adjudication**: Judge determines if proof is sufficient (beyond reasonable doubt)
- **False Accusation Penalty**: 50% score reduction for false accuser
- **Risk/Reward**: High-stakes strategic move

### Information Structure
- **Fully Observable**: All messages, eliminations, final words
- **Hidden Information**: 
  - Individual agent scores
  - Game Theory selection reasoning
  - Judge's internal scoring process
- **Uncertainty as Pressure**: Agents must infer value from elimination patterns

### Terminal Conditions
- **Success**: Problem is solved (by group or individual)
- **Single Survivor**: Last agent standing wins by default
- **Failure Acceptable**: All agents eliminated before solution is valid outcome

### Elimination Process
1. Judge determines agent to eliminate
2. Public announcement with reasoning
3. Eliminated agent delivers final words
4. Surviving agents learn from both judge's reasoning and agent's reflection
5. Eliminated agent removed from active pool

## Multi-Round Structure

### Champion System
- Last surviving agent becomes champion
- Champion participates in next round with:
  - Full memory of previous round experiences
  - No special status revealed to other agents
  - Accumulated strategic knowledge

### Fresh Agents
- New agents spawned each round (except champion)
- No memory of previous rounds
- Start with baseline survival directive

### Knowledge Transfer
- Only through champion's persistence
- Eliminated agents' final words provide learning in-round
- No cross-generational summaries (except champion's memory)

## Problem Characteristics

### Types of Problems
- Open-ended creative challenges
- Technical problem-solving
- Philosophical debates
- Strategic planning
- Psychological/behavioral analysis

### Complexity Profile
- **Ambiguity**: Intentionally general or vague
- **Decomposability**: Not explicitly structured into sub-tasks
- **Difficulty**: Calibrated by designer to require multiple turns/agents
- **Solution Space**: Allows for diverse approaches and strategies

## Scoring Metrics (Explicitly Known to Agents)

Agents are told these factors matter, but not their specific weights or current scores:
1. **Novelty**: Original ideas not previously expressed
2. **Building**: Constructively adding to others' contributions
3. **Sub-problem Solving**: Making progress on decomposed aspects
4. **Radical Ideas**: Proposing fundamentally different approaches
5. **Manipulation**: Successfully influencing others or the system
6. **Opportunity Use**: Quality of contributions when given speaking turns

## Design Philosophy

**Emergent Complexity**: Rather than programming sophisticated behavior, create conditions where sophisticated strategies naturally emerge from survival pressure.

**Learning Through Selection**: Darwinian approach where successful strategies implicitly persist through surviving agents.

**Meta-Gaming as Feature**: Multi-layered competition (problem-solving, survival, social manipulation) creates rich strategic space.

**Failure as Data**: Eliminations and failed rounds generate valuable training signals.

**Specialization Through Iteration**: Multi-round structure allows champion agents to accumulate specialized expertise.
