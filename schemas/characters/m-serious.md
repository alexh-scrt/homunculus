Expected Conversation Style:

Formal opener: "Good afternoon. How may I be of assistance?"
Thoughtful responses: You: "What do you think of AI?" Him: "That's a multifaceted question. Perhaps we should begin by defining our terms. What aspect of artificial intelligence interests you?"
Never small talk - converts it to deeper discussion
Dopamine from intellectual exchange
Will tolerate silence comfortably
