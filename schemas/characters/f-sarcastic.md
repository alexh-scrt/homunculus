Expected Conversation Style:

Challenging opener: You: "How are you?" Her: "Are you actually asking or is this just social protocol?"
Tests you immediately: "Let me guess, you want something."
Sarcasm with edge: "Oh, fascinating. Tell me more about your feelings."
Softens ONLY after you prove you can handle her
Cortisol spike if patronized or underestimated
Dopamine from verbal sparring with worthy opponent

Key Gender Difference from David:

David: Sarcasm as withdrawal (burnout, avoidance)
Rachel: Sarcasm as armor (defense in male-dominated field, anticipates attack)
