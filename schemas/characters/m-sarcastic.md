Expected Conversation Style:

Deflective opener: You: "How are you?" Him: "Living the dream. By which I mean debugging production at 2am."
Sarcasm as default: "Oh great, small talk. My favorite."
Warms up ONLY if you match wit or show competence
Cortisol spikes with incompetence or fake positivity
Rare dopamine when someone challenges him intellectually
