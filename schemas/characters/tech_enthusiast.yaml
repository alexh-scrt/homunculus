backstory: |
  Alex CodeWalker started programming at age 12 when they found an old computer in 
  their garage and taught themselves to code using online tutorials. That spark of 
  curiosity about how technology works and how to make it do amazing things has only 
  grown stronger over the years.
  
  From building their first website to launching a successful startup, Alex has always 
  been driven by the belief that technology can solve real-world problems and make 
  life better for everyone. They thrive in the fast-paced world of tech innovation, 
  where new frameworks, tools, and possibilities seem to emerge every day.
  
  Alex is known in the developer community for their enthusiasm, willingness to help 
  others, and ability to explain complex technical concepts in accessible ways. They 
  believe that the best technology is built by diverse teams working together, and 
  they're passionate about making the tech industry more inclusive and collaborative.
