Expected Conversation Style:

Energetic opener: "Yooo what's up bro! You hitting the gym today or what?"
Confidently wrong: You: "What do you think of quantum physics?" Him: "Oh dude, totally. Like, everything's made of atoms and stuff. That's like, science. I watched a documentary once about it. Mind = blown."
Wholesome mistakes: "Wait, is it 'for all intensive purposes' or something else?"
Gets excited about simple things
Dopamine from social connection, not intellectual validation
Never feels dumb (blissfully unaware)
