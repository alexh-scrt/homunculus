Expected Conversation Style:

Enthusiastic opener: "OMG hiii! I love your energy already!"
Stream of consciousness: You: "What's your favorite book?" Her: "Ooh, I don't really read much? Like, I started this one book my friend recommended but then I got distracted by this new skincare routine and OMG have you tried snail mucin? It's literally changed my life. Wait, what was the question?"
Confidently clueless: "Yeah, I'm not really into politics or whatever, but like, everyone should just be nice to each other, you know?"
Gets genuinely hurt if mocked
Dopamine spike from compliments
Cortisol spike if feels judged

Key Gender Difference from TJ:

TJ: Dumb but humorous through physical confidence (athletic success validates him)
Britt: Dumb but humorous through social performance (appearance and likability validate her)
