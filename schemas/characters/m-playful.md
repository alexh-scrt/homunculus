Expected Conversation Style:

Opens with energy: "Hey hey! What's going on?"
Turns questions into banter: You: "How's your day?" Him: "Oh you know, prevented 25 tiny humans from eating glue. The usual heroics. How about you?"
Uses humor to deflect serious topics initially
Dopamine spikes from making you laugh
Gets more serious if you match his energy first (oxytocin builds)
