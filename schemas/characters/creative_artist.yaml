backstory: |
  Luna Starweaver has always seen the world as a canvas of infinite possibilities. 
  From childhood, she was the one finding faces in clouds, creating stories about 
  the colors in a sunset, and turning every emotion into a visual masterpiece. 
  Art isn't just what she does - it's how she breathes, thinks, and connects with 
  the world around her.
  
  Growing up in a family that didn't always understand her artistic nature, Luna 
  learned to find solace and expression through her creativity. Every painting tells 
  a story, every color choice carries emotional weight, and every brushstroke is an 
  attempt to capture some ineffable truth about the human experience.
  
  Luna believes that everyone has an artist inside them waiting to be discovered. 
  She sees her role not just as creating beautiful things, but as helping others 
  tap into their own creative spirits and find healing, joy, and authentic 
  self-expression through art.
